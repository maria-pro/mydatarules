Cash!\n\nCash management is a really critical issue for both business owners and people like me who are trying not to look at recent interest rates jumps.\n\nCash management includes cash collection, handling, and usage of cash (spending!). It is essential to have **enough** cash to cover immediate expenses, fund business growth and have working capital. Or in simple terms, you need to have enough cash to pay for your coffee, cover your morgage repayment and invest in that [Tesla Model 3](https://www.tesla.com/en_au/model3)\n\n![](img/tesla.jpg)\n\nCash analysis is an important step to assess companies short-term liquidity, evaluate working capital and make decisions about investments.\n\nToday, we are going to have a look at the step that comes before cash flow visualization. Much much earlier.... Before we are able to put cash flow items on a nice graph, we need to obtain those cash flow items \"somehow\".\n\nAccountants don't have cash flow data by default, and there is no magic way to get it. Rather, it is necessary to go transaction by transaction, classify items, group them, collate them, and double-check that they actually occurred! We need to make sure that we are not double-charged as well as we are not underpaying or omitting any of our payments and they are all included in the list.\n\nWe start backwards from this very list and we dig into doing bank reconciliation and in particular, looking at our (business) bank statement. This is indeed a very useful exercise, not only in regards to your business but also for your own expense management.\n\nFor this post, we will work through a very simple example, just looking at a bank statement and poking around. It is a \"personal\" bank statement that comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandhaya4u/august-bank-statement-sandhaya)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncf<-read_csv(\"data/bank_st.csv\")\n\ncf%>%head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  Date     Day   Type  Category `Debit Amount` `Credit Amount` `Closing Balance`\n  <chr>    <chr> <chr> <chr>             <dbl>           <dbl>             <dbl>\n1 1/8/2018 Wedn… Debit Shopping          2500                0           174656.\n2 1/8/2018 Wedn… Debit Shopping           324                0           174332.\n3 2/8/2018 Thur… None  None                 0                0           174332.\n4 3/8/2018 Frid… Debit Shopping           404.               0           173928.\n5 4/8/2018 Satu… Debit Shopping           100                0           173828.\n6 4/8/2018 Satu… Debit Shopping          1395                0           172433.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThis is a typical bank statement you can view in your bank account where each row is a transaction for a particular reporting period (e.g. month). We do not have the name of the second party  for the transactions (e.g. the name of the store or the company that credited/debited the account), but all transactions have been classified - which can be seen under `Category`.\n\nThe dataset has `Debit Amount`, which is when you were charged, and `Credit Amount`, which is when you were paid. The `Closing Balance` is a running balance that shows the amount of cash in your account after the transaction. The most important parts of that `Closing Balance` are the initial and final numbers and they are used to reconcial (= match) balances in your own \"books\" (accounting books!= accounting records). If those number do not match, we investigate individual closing balances for the transactions to identify where we were overpaid or underpaid.\n\nLet's look closer at the data: it is not messy, but not ideal...\n\nColumn names have blanks and they do not play well in functions, so let's use `clean_names()` from `janitor` package to make them more R friendly\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncf<-cf%>%\n  clean_names()\n\ncf%>%head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  date     day       type  category debit_amount credit_amount closing_balance\n  <chr>    <chr>     <chr> <chr>           <dbl>         <dbl>           <dbl>\n1 1/8/2018 Wednesday Debit Shopping        2500              0         174656.\n2 1/8/2018 Wednesday Debit Shopping         324              0         174332.\n3 2/8/2018 Thursday  None  None               0              0         174332.\n4 3/8/2018 Friday    Debit Shopping         404.             0         173928.\n5 4/8/2018 Saturday  Debit Shopping         100              0         173828.\n6 4/8/2018 Saturday  Debit Shopping        1395              0         172433.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat's better! so now all variables are in small letters and have snake_case!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnames(cf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"date\"            \"day\"             \"type\"            \"category\"       \n[5] \"debit_amount\"    \"credit_amount\"   \"closing_balance\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's explore the data and do some simple **counting** - yes, we love to count!\n\nFirst, what is the closing balance and how it changes during the month\n\nBut before we do so, let's have a close look at the `date` column.
