Welcome to my page.

I am a data scientist with R and Python under my belt. I love both data wrangling and ML. What else an ML engineer can say.

By coincidence I am an ML engineer and academic, so this website is my personal project where I share some of my leisure projects and some snippets of my work project

I work with clients across the whole domain of data science, starting with 

- automated data collection - data wrangling - data storytelling 

- to model building and implementation

I am Fellow CPA Australia member and promote the use of data and data tools for business purposes.

Talk to me if you need advice or guidance and 

**OPEN FOR HIRE**
